<h1>Labyrinth</h1>
<img src="intro.png"><br>
<br>
Aftere starting the game, we're presented with a map (@ - player, # - walls).<br>
<br>
<img src="1.png"> <img src="2.png"><br>
<br>
The objective, as can be seen from a piece of the flag visible on the
right side of the screen, is to get to the other side of the maze. <br>
<br>
But, a game where you simply have to find a way through isn't very interesting, 
so the maze is generated in such a way that there's never a<br> way from where
the player is standing, to where the flag is.<br>
<br>

<br>
So, now that we know that what we're supposed to do is impossible without cheating, what's the first thing to do? Decomiple the .pyc file. <br>
Python is very nice in this regard, as the sourcecode obtained this way is usually almost identical to the original code. <br>
On the other hand, Python also supports unicode characters in variable names.<br>
<br>
<img src="code.png" style='max-width:1003px;'><br>
<br>
That doesn't look very inviting.
And while the original does run, decompiled version isn't always as successful.<br>
<br>
<b>So, let's use an alternative approach.</b><br>
The game seems to be connecting somewhere, possibly downloading the map (which the flag is a part of).<br>
Maybe this is as easy as looking at the network traffic?<br>
<br>
<img src="sniff_1.png" style='max-height:500px;'> <img src="sniff_2.png" style='max-height:500px;'><br>
(blue = client -> server; pink = server -> client)<br>
<br>
Except for the column id's and the authentication sequence in the beginning, this looks pretty simple - client is asking for and then receiving<br>column descriptions. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, client requests missing columns when they are actually 
 needed - when the character moves enough to trigger scrolling<br>
<br>
We can't read the map from the network traffic and we can't write our own client because we have no idea what happend to the column id's. <br>
(Side note: the server will kick players requesting columns too far away from their position, and we wouldn't know the order anyways)<br>
<br>
But, let's take another look at that screenshot. <br>
<br>
<img src="sniff_3.png" style='max-height:500px;'><br>
<br>
Looks like the client is only sending horizontal movements. This means that the server doesn't have enough information to check whether or not the player is moving through walls!<br>
<br>
(It could check if it's possible to get as far as the client did if
 it mapped out how far to the right it's ever possible to get in the maze, <br>
 but, spoiler alert, it does not.)<br>
<br>
Let's remove the ceiling from the map using python for a simple mitm attack. <br>
<br>
<img src="mitm.png"> <img src="solv.png"><br>
<br>
<b>What does this code do?</b> <br>It listens on port 31337 for incoming connections, and when one is estabilished, 
it connects to the original labyrinth server relaying traffic<br> back and forth. 
When the authentication success message is detected, it starts changing every message coming from the server<br> so that they start with a 0 - effectively removing ceiling from the map.<br>(at that point, server only responds with column descriptions, or kick messages, we don't care what happens if we get kicked)
<br>
<br>(Side note: this code assumes that the column descriptions are received entirely, and one by one. <br>This doesn't always have to be the case, but it works well enough here.)<br><br>
After adding "127.0.0.1 jhtc4bsk.jhtc.pl" to /etc/hosts and starting the program, the task is solved.<br>
